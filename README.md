> Most AI video tools generate a clip. Atlas Marketing Studio gives you the ad workflow around it: product input, script, shots, reference assets, video generation, credits, login, and deployment.

## What this project is

[Marketing Studio](https://atlas-saas-starter.atlascloudai.workers.dev/) is a self-hostable AI ad generator for e-commerce teams, agencies, and builders, powered by [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=atlas-marketing-studio). It turns product photos, presenter images, product links, prompts, or reference ads into ready-to-use video ad concepts.

This is not a generic AI SaaS starter. It is a real, runnable e-commerce creative studio with opinionated workflows for:

- AI UGC ads and product review videos
- Reference-ad remakes with your own product and presenter
- Short drama ads for social commerce
- Two-person ad skits from a simple product idea
- Multi-model image, video, LLM, TTS, and lip-sync pipelines
- Credit metering, Google login, Stripe top-ups, and Cloudflare deployment

## AI ad workflows

Each workflow is a complete AI ad generation path, not just a single model call.

Demo links use the hosted app path. If you self-host, keep the same paths on your own domain.

| Workflow | What it does | Use it for | Models | Try it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **UGC Product Ad** | Product + presenter photos -> lip-synced UGC ad | An **AI UGC ad generator** or **product-to-video ad generator** for product reviews, creator testimonials, direct-response e-commerce ads, and social ad variations. | OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.7-plus` prompt expansion, `nano-banana/edit` first frame, `x-ai/grok-imagine-video` image-to-video | [Open UGC Product Ad](https://atlas-saas-starter.atlascloudai.workers.dev/marketing-studio) |
| **Reference to Ad** | Upload a viral ad -> remake it with your product and presenter | A **reference ad remake AI workflow** for adapting proven ad structure, talent framing, and product placement to your own offer. | `gemini-omni-flash/video-edit`, optional ElevenLabs TTS, optional `veed/lipsync`, fallback to `kling motion-control` | [Open Reference to Ad](https://atlas-saas-starter.atlascloudai.workers.dev/ad-reference) |
| **AI Drama Ad** | One topic -> comedy script -> shot-by-shot drama ad | An **AI short drama ad generator** for social commerce, story-led e-commerce ads, and short-form video campaigns. | OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.7-plus` script generation, reference image generation, `x-ai/grok-imagine-video` per shot | [Open AI Drama Ad](https://atlas-saas-starter.atlascloudai.workers.dev/drama-studio) |
| **Ad Skit** | One-line product -> two-person comedy skit | A **short ad skit generator** for creator ads, TikTok-style product jokes, hook testing, and fast creative iteration. | OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.7-plus` script generation, `gpt-image-2` product shot, `x-ai/grok-imagine-video` with audio | [Open Ad Skit](https://atlas-saas-starter.atlascloudai.workers.dev/ad-skit) |

All workflows auto-detect the input language. Write the product brief in English, Chinese, or another language, and the generated script/ad follows that language.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtlasCloudAI/atlas-marketing-studio.git
cd atlas-marketing-studio
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Fill the required values in `.dev.vars`:

```bash
ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
DIRECT_URL=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=atlas
```

Optional Stripe checkout variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Where to get each value:

| Variable | Where to get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY` | [Atlas Cloud API Keys](https://www.atlascloud.ai/docs/api-keys) | Create an Atlas Cloud API key for image, audio, upload, TTS, and lip-sync generation. API keys are shown once, so store it safely. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [OpenRouter API Keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) | Used for text generation with `qwen/qwen3.7-plus` and video generation with `x-ai/grok-imagine-video`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | [Neon connection string](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app) | Use the pooled Neon Postgres connection string for the app runtime. |
| `DIRECT_URL` | [Neon direct connection](https://neon.com/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app) | Use the direct Neon Postgres connection string for Prisma migrations. It can be the same project/database as `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | [NextAuth secret](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#nextauth_secret) | Generate locally with `openssl rand -base64 32`. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | [Google Cloud OAuth clients](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients) | Create a Web application OAuth client for Google sign-in. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | [Google Cloud OAuth clients](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients) | Copy the client secret from the same Web application OAuth client. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) | Optional. Required only when `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=stripe`. Use test keys for local development. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | [Stripe Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) | Optional. Required for Stripe webhook verification in production. Local webhook secrets can also come from `stripe listen`. |

Then run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Get an Atlas Cloud API key at [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=atlas-marketing-studio) and an OpenRouter API key at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).

## Deploy

Use the same environment variables from Quick start for both deployment paths.

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAtlasCloudAI%2Fatlas-marketing-studio&env=ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY,OPENROUTER_API_KEY,DATABASE_URL,DIRECT_URL,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,PAYMENT_PROVIDER&envDescription=Atlas%20Cloud%20and%20OpenRouter%20API%20keys%2C%20Neon%20database%20URLs%2C%20NextAuth%20secret%2C%20Google%20OAuth%20credentials%2C%20and%20payment%20provider&project-name=atlas-marketing-studio&repository-name=atlas-marketing-studio)

Vercel is the fastest path for a standard Next.js deployment. Import the repository, add the environment variables from Quick start, and deploy.

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
npm run cf:deploy
```

For Cloudflare, set production secrets with Wrangler or the Cloudflare dashboard:

```bash
wrangler secret put ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY
wrangler secret put OPENROUTER_API_KEY
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
wrangler secret put NEXTAUTH_SECRET
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Secrets should never be committed to the repository.

## Credits and pricing

Users spend in-app credits while your deployment pays Atlas Cloud in USD. The app maps AI generation cost to credits:

- Fixed-cost steps such as image generation, LLM scripts, and TTS use flat credit prices.
- Video generation uses dynamic pricing based on model, duration, and resolution.

`src/lib/video-pricing.ts` calculates video credits like this:

```text
credits = ceil(perSecond[resolution] * seconds * ACCOUNT_MARKUP * MARGIN / CREDIT_USD)
```

Top-up packs live in `src/config/pricing.ts`, so you can adjust margin and packaging in one place.
